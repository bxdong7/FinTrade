1. Go over what I finished in the last week:
	1. Added logging to the program
	2. Found out that LSTM is no longer supported within SB3. Might be added in later versions, only possibility is RecurrentPPO but that is only available in the sb3_dev repo.
	3. Containerized the model creation into a function. Class?
	4. Sent PR regarding issues I am having with the classes.ipynb file.
	5. What more to add the the model?
2. Talk about Dr. Coutras not answering my email...
3. Set up time to go over how to fix the classes file. I really want to move on with that part... That is the only part of this project holding me back from getting above a passing grade.
4. What is next?
	1. What is required for the paper?
	2. The presentation?
	3. When would the presentation take place if one is required, and is it in person/virtual? Do other people attend?
	4. What is the timeline for completion?
